# Uber-Ride-Analysis

#Introduction 
This project examines Uber trip data using visualizations and analysis presented in a Shiny app. By utilizing the charts and maps, we can explore trip patterns by hour, month, day, and location, gaining insights into Uber ride trends. The interface also includes a geospatial map feature for visualizing trip locations. In addition, a predictive ride model forecasts future trip demand based on historical data. This analysis will be helpful in exploring and understanding Uber trip patterns, which will ultimately help in informing decision-making and optimizing ride-sharing services.
